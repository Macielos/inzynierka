# Mobile MMO game with cloud backend in Google App Engine prepared as a project for my engineering thesis. 

The map consists of regions connected by passages or portals. New regions are generated procedurally as the player count rises. 

In most regions there is a town and several dungeons to be explored. In a town visiting player can recruit troops for gold. In dungeon player fights various monsters, for victory he can gain experience, resources and artifacts. 

Graphically the game is very simple, it uses some textures from Warcraft 3 and hiveworkshop.com. I don't own them or use them to make any profit, should I decide to continue and commericalize the project, all assets would be replaced by my own ones.
